    "description": "Beeswax is a sticky substance produced naturally from bees, traditionally used as the 'first plastic'. Wraps made out of beeswax are hence more organic and pliable, offering a sustainable and long-lasting solution to plastic wraps.\n\nIn a bid to bring brand personality alongside a tactical product-driven communication approach, we highlight, through a quirky 30 sec YouTube ad, the sticky situation plastic-use brings and how Gaia’s sustainable and long-lasting wraps are the perfect antidote.",

The brand has a history of fighting for human rights so I focused on that aspect and created a campaign to fight against patriarchal norms and homophobia.\n\nAs coming out is an important and difficult step in life for LGBTQ+ people, campaign is aimed at normalizing the process and making it part of our everyday lives.",

The game was designed by the local board game club Tsibakha Games.\n\nMain theme of the game is inspired by football. In alternative world on imaginary Robobo island 11 city-states with massive gas stations battle for one ultimate goal and each city-state had it's own sets of unique robots with different capabilities and powers.\n\nMy role in the project was to design all the visual assets including character designs, logo and packaging design.
