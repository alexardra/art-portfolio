    "description": "Beeswax is a sticky substance produced naturally from bees, traditionally used as the 'first plastic'. Wraps made out of beeswax are hence more organic and pliable, offering a sustainable and long-lasting solution to plastic wraps.\n\nIn a bid to bring brand personality alongside a tactical product-driven communication approach, we highlight, through a quirky 30 sec YouTube ad, the sticky situation plastic-use brings and how Gaia’s sustainable and long-lasting wraps are the perfect antidote.",
